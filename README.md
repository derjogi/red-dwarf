# Red Dwarf

A <em>DIM</em>ensional <em>RED</em>uction library for [stellarpunk][] democracy into the long haul.

> Stars are fires that burn for thousands of years. Some of them burn slow and

> Supernovas, they're brighter than the brightest galaxies. They die, and

## Goals

Code that aspires to embody and support democratic values should be...

- **Legible.** It should be explorable and auditable not just to researchers, but to as many curious citizens as possible.
- **Re-usable.** It should be easily used in contexts in which it's original creators did not anticipate, nor perhaps even desire.
- **Collectively stewarded.** It should grow and govern itself democratically and in a plural fashion.
