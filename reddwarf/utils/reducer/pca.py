    Process a prepared vote matrix to be imputed and return projected participant data,

    The vote matrix should not yet be imputed, as this will happen within the method.

    Args:
        vote_matrix (pd.DataFrame): A vote matrix of data. Non-imputed values are expected.
        n_components (int): Number n of principal components to decompose the `vote_matrix` into.

        pca (PCA): PCA object, notably with the following attributes:
            - components_ (List[List[float]]): Eigenvectors of principal `n` components, one per column/statement/feature.
            - explained_variance_ (List[float]): Explained variance of each principal component.
